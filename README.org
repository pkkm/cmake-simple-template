* CMake template for a simple application
  The Makefile in the top-level directory is just a convenient wrapper for compiling and running the program, using CMake and =make= as appropriate.

** Usage
  - =make= :: If the =build= directory exists, run =make= there to recompile the program. If it doesn't, create it, generate a Makefile using CMake and compile the program using =make=.
  - =make compile-run= :: Build (like the above) and run the program.
  - =make run= :: Run the program.
  - =make clean= :: Delete the =build= directory.
