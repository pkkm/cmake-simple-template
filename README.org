* Template for a simple application built with CMake

The Makefile in the top-level directory is just a wrapper that runs CMake or Make as appropriate.

** Usage

Replace =myproject= with the name of your project in =CMakeLists.txt= and =Makefile=. Then use the following commands:

- =make= :: Ensure the =build= directory exists; run =cmake= and =make= there.
- =make run= :: Run the program.
- =make test= :: Run tests.
- =make clean= :: Delete the =build= directory.
