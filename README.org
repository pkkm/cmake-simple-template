* CMake template for a simple application

The Makefile in the top-level directory is just a wrapper that runs CMake or Make as appropriate.

** Usage

Replace =myproject= with the name of your project in =CMakeLists.txt= and =Makefile=. Then, use the following commands:

- =make= :: If the =build= directory exists, run =make= there to recompile the program. If it doesn't, create it, generate a Makefile using CMake and compile the program using =make=.
- =make run= :: Run the program.
- =make clean= :: Delete the =build= directory.
